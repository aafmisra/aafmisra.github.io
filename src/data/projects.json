After proving myself on the Kinetic Demolition project, I was tapped again as lead developer. I took it as a huge vote of confidence that the whole team entrusted me with that responsibility for our company's own website. This was also my first time exploring Sanity CMS, and I loved it so much!",

The client had a very exciting opportunity to partner with a public university where this app would be used in classrooms. I was given an accessibility audit report done by a third party, did all the necessary remediation to get the app compliant with Section 508, and drafted a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template for the client. My remediation work was essential to their ability to sign a lucrative deal with the university. It was so fulfilling to do this work knowing it would improve the experience of using the app for all of the students. It was also very cool to see how much I had learned about web accessibility in the 3 years since the app was first launched!",

    "highlights": "This project involved recreating an old archived site with important research for the Agelab. The original version of the site was composed largely of images and graphics as data visualizations, with no accessible alternative. Navigating the site with a screen reader felt like surfing mostly empty pages. I created markdown fields in the client's existing CMS so that I could organize all of the text and data from the image graphics into tables. This enabled me to render the data as visually-hidden HTML elements on the front end, vastly improving the site for any visually-impaired or non-sighted users.",
