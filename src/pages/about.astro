      <h1 id="main-heading">Hi! I'm Asha 👋🏼</h1>

      <p>I'm a frontend developer with 5 years of experience on a wonderful team at a web design and development agency. Being on a small team meant that I was writing production code from day one. Eventually I gained enough experience to plan <a href="/projects">projects</a> from the design stage and lead their development. Along the way I specialized in web accessibility, acting as a resource for my co-workers during development of new projects and performing accessibility audits and remediation on existing sites.</p>

      <p>I'm currently seeking a new role where I can use my creativity and attention to detail to build software that enriches peoples' lives. I'm adept at CSS and I love a difficult design challenge such as a complex layout. My background in zoo & museum exhibit development gave me an invaluable developer skill — putting myself in the user's shoes. I apply this skill every day to make elegant, efficient, effective, and above all accessible products. <a href="mailto:aafmisra@gmail.com">Drop me a line if you'd like to work together!</a></p>
