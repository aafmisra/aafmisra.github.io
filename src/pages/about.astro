      <h1>Hi! I'm Asha 👋🏼</h1>

      <p>I'm a frontend developer with 5 years experience on a wonderful team at a web design and development agency working with many diverse clients. Being on a small team meant that I was writing production code from day 1. Eventually I gained enough experience to plan <a href="/projects">projects</a> from the design stage and lead their development. Along the way I specialized in web accessibility, acting as a resource for my co-workers during development of new projects and performing accessibility audits and remediation on existing sites.</p>

      <p>I'm currently seeking a new role where I can use my creativity and attention to detail to build software that enriches peoples' lives. I'm adept at CSS and I love a difficult design challenge such as a complex layout. My background in zoo & museum exhibit development gave me an invaluable developer skill — putting myself in the user's shoes. I apply this skill every day to make elegant, efficient, effective, and above all accessible products. <a href="mailto:aafmisra@gmail.com">Drop me a line if you'd like to work together!</a></p>

        Knitting and needlefelting are some of my favorite ways to pass the time. Making things for people is my love language, and felted pet portraits and nursery mobiles are my favorite things to make. <a href="mailto:aafmisra@gmail.com">Send me an email</a> if you'd like to commission something!
